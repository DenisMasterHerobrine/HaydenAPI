<div align="center"> <h1>HaydenAPI</h1> </div>
<div align="center"> A massive framework with lots of utility classes and builders. Mainly created to make life easier, when doing AI or space projects or Minecraft modding. </div>

<div align="center"> <h1>About</h1> </div>
Currently it is just a very simple API with a small bunch of builders. Will be eventually updated from time to time. No ETA on any releases.

<div align="center"> <h1>Why?</h1> </div>
Because I suffer when writing the same code lots of times. Also this will help me to consider to rework some parts of old code into something better and optimized. 

<div align="center"> <h1>Why that name?</h1> </div>
Because it was inspired by my favourite game, but at the moment it have nothing related to it. Feel free to ask me to change the name of this API or something else from this if you have rights and don't want to have some DOOM-inspired names to be here.

<div align="center"> <h1>Modules</h1> </div>

- **main**: A feature-rich Java/C++ library to allow to do system calls or get builders for any tasks you wish to. Still WIP.

- **forge**: An API/Library for creating Minecraft mods under Forge ecosystem.

- **fabric**: An API/Library for creating Minecraft mods under Fabric ecosystem.

- **spigot**: An API/Library for creating Minecraft mods under Spigot ecosystem.

- probably more to come.
